However, not all of them were given a digital form or have any sort of documentation (specially projects based on code) as it was not part of the evaluation. For the courses in which any sort of documentation is available, it will be displayed either trough images or with a downloadable PDF of the assignment.</p> <p><strong><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> NOTE:</strong> The courses were mainly taught in portuguese.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"></p> <h3 id="description"><b>Description</b></h3> <p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;">Aerospace Engineering has played an increasingly important role in the 21st century, through the development of different types of vehicles such as airplanes, helicopters, robotised aircraft and the air traffic management itself. It also brings us closer to Space, particularly through the development of rockets and satellites, thus contributing to the improvement of communication channels. The role of an Aerospace Engineer is to design and conceive air and space vehicles, as well as to develop all associated support and control systems.</p> <h4 id="overview"><b>Overview</b></h4> <p>The Bachelor programme in Aerospace Engineering is a synthesis of advanced technologies that distinguish the 20th century from those that preceded it, which are of increasing importance in the 21st century; they are integrated in various types of vehicles, such as airplanes, helicopters, robotic aircraft, rockets and satellites and in associated support means such as air traffic management and other operational aspects.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;">All these vehicles integrate dynamics of atmospheric, orbital and interplanetary flight, and a wide range of modern technologies, which include aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, materials, manufacturing processes, control, computing, electronics, telecommunications, artificial intelligence, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic and other systems.</p> <h4 id="history"><b>History</b></h4> <p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;">The Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering was established in 1991 through the Integrated Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering, with an initial numerus clausus of 35, which gradually increased to the current 135 with a consistently growing intake.
