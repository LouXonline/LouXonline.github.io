### <b>Introduction</b>

On the 1st of October of 2021 I started my bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering [^1] at <a href='https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/'>Instituto Superior Técnico</a>. Over the course of the next three years this would be my main focus and, on the side, I participated in a variety of activites which broadened my knowledge in a multitude of areas. Two big projects which I would like to highlight, and to which I contributed, are <a href = "/projects/red/">Rocket Experiment Division</a> and <a href = "/projects/acrobat/">Acrobat</a>.

#### <b>Organisation</b>

The majority of the courses were evaluated on pen and paper based mid-term tests and final exams. In some of the courses, lab assignments and projects were to be developed and delivered. However, not all of them were given a digital form or have any sort of documentation (specially projects based on code) as it was not part of the evaluation. For the courses in which any sort of documentation is available, it will be displayed either trough images or with a downloadable PDF of the assignment.

**<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> NOTE:** The courses were mainly taught in portuguese.

### <b>Description</b>

<p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;">Aerospace Engineering has played an increasingly important role in the 21st century, through the development of different types of vehicles such as airplanes, helicopters, robotised aircraft and the air traffic management itself. It also brings us closer to Space, particularly through the development of rockets and satellites, thus contributing to the improvement of communication channels. The role of an Aerospace Engineer is to design and conceive air and space vehicles, as well as to develop all associated support and control systems.</p>







#### <b>Overview</b>

The Bachelor programme in Aerospace Engineering is a synthesis of advanced technologies that distinguish the 20th century from those that preceded it, which are of increasing importance in the 21st century; they are integrated in various types of vehicles, such as airplanes, helicopters, robotic aircraft, rockets and satellites and in associated support means such as air traffic management and other operational aspects.

<p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;">All these vehicles integrate dynamics of atmospheric, orbital and interplanetary flight, and a wide range of modern technologies, which include aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, materials, manufacturing processes, control, computing, electronics, telecommunications, artificial intelligence, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic and other systems.</p>






#### <b>History</b>

<p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;">The Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering was established in 1991 through the Integrated Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering, with an initial numerus clausus of 35, which gradually increased to the current 135 with a consistently growing intake. The minimum entry grade has always been the highest among all engineering programs in Portugal and recently became the highest among all university courses. The Aerospace Engineering program is dedicated to maximizing the potential of all its students.</p>






#### <b>Objectives</b>

At the end of the Degree in Aerospace Engineering, the student should have developed knowledge and skills to:

- To conceive, design, manufacture, and operate systems and products using creativity, critical thinking, autonomy, and an interdisciplinary approach.

- To solve engineering problems in various contexts, considering technological, economic, social, and environmental constraints.

- To handle complex aerospace engineering problems, even when faced with limited or incomplete information. Be able to make judgments while considering ethical and social implications and responsibilities.

- To navigate and interact on professional situations in diverse industrial organizations, services, research, and cultural and educational settings.

<p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;"></p>




#### <b>Designed for</b>

The Aerospace Engineering program has several attractive features:

- High-quality education aimed at fully developing the potential of students who enter with the highest grades in higher education.

- A wide range of choices in the master's program, covering most of the current areas of advanced technology.

- Access to specialized laboratories, including those focused on aeronautics, as well as computational resources and dedicated projects such as nanosatellites.

- Faculty members actively engaged in high-level research, capable of supervising master's and doctoral theses in various domains.

- Opportunities for dual degrees and Erasmus exchanges with some of the best universities in Europe and beyond.

- Excellent job prospects both in Portugal and abroad in the aerospace, space, consulting, and other sectors.

##### Flight Testing (2023/2024 - 2nd Semester) 	

###### <u>Objectives</u>

Acquisition of relevant knowledge on flight test instrumentation systems and flight test techniques: - Flight test concept; - Study of flight test instrumentation systems; - Analysis and application of flight test techniques. The first two objectives are addressed in the theoretical component, being supported by updated bibliographic elements. The final objective will be addressed by the students, through the elaboration and presentation, in a class, of 1 (one) synthesis work on a flight test application. There will be 2 (two) experimental works, involving instrumentation systems, processing and data analysis. The inherent reports will be prepared and delivered during the class period.
