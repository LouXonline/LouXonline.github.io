Originally from the <a href="https://www.visitazores.com/en/the-azores">Azorean islands</a> in the middle of the Atlantic, I have embarked on a journey to learn more about engineering and its impact on society. This website allows me to share my experiences and ideas. You may access my [`Blog`](/blog/) to know more about my perspectives, my [`Curriculum`](/cv/) for information regarding my professional journey, as well as [`Projects`](/projects/) and [`Publications`](/publications/) for more details.

To know more about why I started this project, read [`Why this website?`](/blog/2024/first-post/). For further guidance on how to navigate in the website, you may check [`Website navigation`](/blog/notfound/). And if you would like to get in touch with me, feel free to use any of the socials available at the <a href="#bottom">bottom of the page</a>.
