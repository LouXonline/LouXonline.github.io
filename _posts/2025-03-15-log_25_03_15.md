### <b>Week drawbacks</b>

No major drawbacks. *Human Factors* study could have been better, but time was not wasted per say. SupaeroMoon communications team has been hard to support with lack of time.

### <b>Week upsides</b>

Waiting for recommendation letter to apply for summer school. New member in SupaeroMoon Power team, with electrical engineering as bachelor background. Got an interview scheduled for an MSBA program. Company contacted me to support on AI model development. Started Robotics in Space course, co-funded by the European-Union.
