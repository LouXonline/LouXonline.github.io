### <b>Week drawbacks</b>

- Weigh lifting sessions heavily compromised by poor time management, specially when it came to the *Electromagnetism Applied to Avionics* exam. Content is naturally complex and led to constant frustration of not enough study being done. Constant tiredness throughout the week as a consequence.

- Poor chess performance in the Ligue d'ing√©nieur fran√ßais d'√©checs tournament. As stated before, not enough energy throughout the week, with additional load of a long day before the tournament.

- *Human Factors* evaluation could have been almost completed if not for the lack of energy. It led to constant distractions. Submission is due in 1 month.

### <b>Priorities</b>

##### Top priorities
- Master's degree (Aerospace engineering)
- Research project (Space Rover Fleet Supervision Tool)
- Exercise routine (goal: 2 days running + 3 days weightlifting)
