### <b>Overview</b>

_Atomic Habits_ by James Clear is a practical guide to building good habits and breaking bad ones through small, incremental changes that compound into significant results. Clear introduces the Four Laws of Behavior Change—make it obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying—as a framework for creating lasting habits by leveraging the habit loop of cue, craving, response, and reward. Emphasizing systems over goals, the book highlights how tiny adjustments, like improving 1% daily, can lead to exponential growth over time. By focusing on identity-based habits, where actions align with the person you want to become, Clear provides actionable strategies, backed by behavioral science, to transform routines and achieve long-term success.
