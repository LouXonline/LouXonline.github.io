<p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"></p>

### <b>Week drawbacks</b>

Optimization evaluation did not go as expected. Not the best dynamic in the duo. Also, the use of AI to help in the development of the code slowed things down.

<p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"></p>

### <b>Week upsides</b>

Managed to go to all of the events planned. Exercise routine close to goal. Good eating. Bought the Super Duolingo family plan in order to keep up my goals with french learning. It is a fun way of learning the language. Finished the _Atomic Habits_ book by James Clear. Now will go on with _What would Nietzsche do?_ by Marcus Weeks
