### <b>Drawbacks</b>
- Although I tried to be organized with the journal, proposing some tasks for each day, I was unable to fulfill them all. It seems unhuman to be that detailed. Perhaps noting down the responsibilities I have with other people is what makes sense to be detailed in space and time. Personal tasks may be proposed for the entire week.
- The Ubuntu installation had an error when setting up the USB stick, and the installation of the ISO file and the USB setup itself  take longer than what I was expecting.

### <b>Priorities</b>

##### Top priorities
- Master's degree    
- Exercise routine (goal: 2 days running + 3 days weightlifting)   
- Close social group (partner, friends, family)            
- French (Duolingo + Self-learning + Conversations)  
- Book               

##### Second priorities
- Chess             
- SupaeroMoon        
- Coursera           
- Website            

##### Occasional but still important
- LinkedIn           
- Budgeting          

##### Not important but good for free-time
- Khan academy       
- W3schools          
- Tryhackme       
- *Some video-games*   

##### On the list for candidate activities
- Hack the box

### <b>Week Summary</b>

Bad week? Not really. The (?) mean that the task was performed, but not in the indicated time frame. Two runs and one weight lifting session. Among the top priorities, it seems that the exercise routine is always the one sacrificed. Next semester the research project I am going to be involved in is going to step up as a top priority as well since it belongs to the Master's Degree. I will keep trying to do this journaling, this time with a more "human approach."

I was able to join the ISAE-SUPEARO chess team, which will be participating in the *Ligue d'ing√©nieur fran√ßais d'√©checs*. Additionally, the SupaeroMoon group is doing an amazing job with the rover. They will deliver it on Monday to the MDRS team. I wish I was more of use to them, but time has been tight.
