But sometimes you’ve got to break your little bubble of comfort and challenge yourself. Missing classes and organizing your schedule and assignments ahead of time is very good thing, but it also requires a different mentality, enabling you to be in a rhythm so different from everyone else.</p> <p>On a completely random day (literally), my friend Mariana messaged our group saying that she had found very cheap airplane tickets and AirBnB’s to Bergamo, an italian city very close to the famous city of Milan. The planed seemed good, and so we invested in the idea and moved forward with the plan. Me, Mariana, Tiago and Sara would go on a spontaneous adventure to Italy in the middle of the semester. My strict time management wouldn’t let me be too radical, so we planned the days so that we wouldn’t miss neither important classes nor evaluations. And so we went on the adventure.</p> <h3 id="the-preparation">The preparation</h3> <p>The tickets cost 15€ each, and the AirBnB a total of 180€ for the four of us. The prices were good! But of course there was a small catch: the flights we were taking were from Ryanair. And what does that mean? We could only bring one handbag wih us. Well… is that such a bad thing? For four days of traveling, maybe not so much. So the only thing I took with me was my old orange backpack.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bergamo/backpack.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bergamo/backpack.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bergamo/backpack.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bergamo/backpack.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Backpack for the trip </div> <h3 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h3> <p>I’ve had the experience of going to the airport on my own, with family and colleagues (for sports and other kinds of tournaments), but not solely with friends. I have to say that the organization is a lot different. I wanted to leave half an hour earlier than the others wanted to, but it was three against one. So we arranged half an hour later than what I thought would be a good hour.</p> <p>The time came, and without directing anything to anyone, we were all four at the planned gate almost 20 minutes after the scheduled time, which makes it 50 minutes after what I would think was a decent time to leave. The result? Everyone slightly stressed out with the time, although unnecessarily. But this was a group trip, so either everyone or no one at the plane.</p> <p>After three means of public transportation, we arrived at the airport at the Ryanair’s recommended time. So we passed security, got ourselves some food (I got a very good burger!) and went for the gate. The flight delayed half an hour while we were already between the gate and the door for the taxiways. As it seemed, there were problems with refuelling the plane’s water tank. Eventually, we got in. The flight would take an hour and a half.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bergamo/airport-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bergamo/airport-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bergamo/airport-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bergamo/airport.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bergamo/ryanair-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bergamo/ryanair-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bergamo/ryanair-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bergamo/ryanair.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bergamo/flight-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bergamo/flight-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bergamo/flight-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bergamo/flight.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Flight from Toulouse (France) to Bergamo (Italy) </div> <h3 id="1st-day-bergamo-at-nighttime">1st day: Bergamo at nighttime</h3> <p>We arrived already during the night.

It was a very neat place for the price: two rooms, a living room, a kitchen and one bathroom. It was fully equipped with whatever we needed besides food (obviously), and so we went on a quick exploration for places to eat. We ate at a pastry, then at a place famously known for their focaccias, and ended up eating at a somewhat random restaurant. That was it for the first day. As a surprise, it randomly started snowing on the tight streets we were walking by. It made for a unique experience.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bergamo/fancy_light-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bergamo/fancy_light-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bergamo/fancy_light-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bergamo/fancy_light.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Once back at the AirBnB, we would plan the next day: Milan!

So the group got themselves some more cozy clothes (besides me ☺).

There was a little market in the center of Bergamo from which I bought a small wooden plane with 145 pieces. I am still in the process of building it as I am writing this post. After that, we got ice cream and a brownie and went back to the AirBnB.

We ate an ice cream at the place we had before and passed by the little market in the center again. Then it was time to go to the airport.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bergamo/night_cool-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bergamo/night_cool-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bergamo/night_cool-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bergamo/night_cool.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bergamo/night_two-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bergamo/night_two-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bergamo/night_two-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bergamo/night_two.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bergamo/night_three-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bergamo/night_three-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bergamo/night_three-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bergamo/night_three.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bergamo/night_four-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bergamo/night_four-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bergamo/night_four-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bergamo/night_four.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3 id="coming-back">Coming back</h3> <p>Our plan was simple: got to the airport at around 11pm, get passed security and stay at the gate doors until they opened. This way, we could maybe get some sleep or even work on our little projects. As it seems, the airport logistics were against us, and the gates’ section area would be closed until 3am. So… we basically stayed near the airport’s hall entrance until the gates would open. Some managed to get some sleep in the meanwhile.</p> <p>Once inside the gate section area, some of us got some more sleep and eventually we got inside the plane. Tip: do not carry hand bags with Ryanair if you bought the simple flight ticket without any add-ons.</p> <p>We got to Toulouse before lunchtime and simply took a <em>Bolt</em> back to campus. For the rest of the day, I would rest.</p> <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h2> <p>I’ve decided that these posts are going to also be for retrospection, so in the end I will resume what I have learned and what were the key points.</p> <p>This small trip allowed me to be a more spontaneous person. Besides that, I got to make decisions for myself on what to do in a place which was completely new to me. My responsibility was put into test. While writing this post I realized I might have to be more organized with my pictures as I still have a lot of bad ones and others repeated in my phone’s gallery. I could have taken more pictures of the food I ate too, which is closely associated with the local culture. Additionally, I am finding the flow of writing fascinating since I am not really stopping from writing and checking for what I have written. There might be some mistakes and badly phrased ideas, but I feel like I need to start using my time more efficiently. So, I will use AI to review my text and rewrite it to find and fix these potential mistakes. I will try to keep the writing as close as possible to the original form, since I still want to leave the touch of my own words in the posts.</p> <p>Next, I plan to work on a post related to the week I spent in the southern part of France with my parents. The dates of the posts are not accurate as I want them to reflect a date near the end of the experiences. This is another thing I want to work on: do things at the right time and not do them later.</p> <p>Note: As it can be seen, the formatting is not quite pleasing. This will still undergo some maintenance.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="free-time"/><category term="photography"/><category term="hobbies"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploring Bergamo and Milan city]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Arrival at France</title><link href="https://louxonline.github.io/blog/2024/cosmoscope/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Arrival at France"/><published>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://louxonline.github.io/blog/2024/cosmoscope</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://louxonline.github.io/blog/2024/cosmoscope/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nodes and links]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">An Introduction to Photography</title><link href="https://louxonline.github.io/blog/2024/photography/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An Introduction to Photography"/><published>2024-08-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-08-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://louxonline.github.io/blog/2024/photography</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://louxonline.github.io/blog/2024/photography/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="smartphone-transition">Smartphone transition</h3> <p>I have recently acquired a new smartphone, the iPhone 15 Pro. My last one was the iPhone 6S Plus, so it was a pretty big change. Not only in power, but in camera capabilities. This is even more evident if your old phone's camera does not focus on any object or area.</p> <p>Photography hasn't been a big interest of mine, or at least investing time in it was something I rarely considered. I would occasionally find amazing images shared in the internet of different places, moments, landscapes... Some of them very pleasant to observe. Why not create my own? Well, I never had the tools to begin with. But I gave it a shot recently.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"></p> <h3 id="the-first-picture">The first picture</h3> <p>I went on a trip to Furnas in my home island São Miguel with my parents and grandma. We ate breakfast there in the silence of the morning by the lake. This was my first proper picture with the phone:</p> <img-comparison-slider> <figure slot="first"> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas_unedited-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas_unedited-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas_unedited-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas_unedited.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Morning by the Furnas' lake unedited" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure slot="second"> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Morning by the Furnas edited' lake" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </img-comparison-slider> <div class="caption"> Morning by the Furnas' lake </div> <p>I explored a few of the editing functionalities the iPhone provides in the camera app and tried to make the image more pleasant. My main idea with the editing on this one was to make it feel like a calm morning, vegetation standing out with some humidity and vibrant but realistic colors, and displaying a clear blue sky. I believe it was a good result. Nonetheless, it was a first attempt at editing.</p> <p>One of the key aspects I learned through this is that too much editing may be doing exactly what you want in general, but the image may lose detail in some areas. This is not optimal, unless it isn’t noticeable. The bushes are the main object affected by the editing in negative terms, losing some detail to darker tones. However, it gives the impression that the tree’s shadow has some influence in the matter.</p> <p>Below is a brief description of every functionality I explored<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p> <p><strong>Light controls:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Exposure - act as though more or less light got into the lens</li> <li>Brilliance - lighten shadows while toning down highlights</li> <li>Highlights - adjust the brightness of the lightest parts in the image</li> <li>Shadows - adjust the brightness of the darkest parts in the image</li> <li>Contrast - make the darker parts darker and the lighter parts lighter</li> <li>Brightness - make the entire image lighter or darker</li> <li>Black point - adjust the very darkest part of the image</li> </ul> <p><strong>Color controls:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Saturation - change the intensity of colors in the image</li> <li>Vibrancy - change the intensity of the least saturated colors</li> <li>Warmth - adjust the yellow and blue tones to warm or cool an image.</li> <li>Tint - adjust the green or magenta tones in your image</li> </ul> <p><strong>Detail controls:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Sharpness - sharpen the edges in your image</li> <li>Definition - make the details in your image clearer</li> <li>Noise reduction - reduce the graininess in your image</li> <li>Vignette - darken the corners of the image</li> </ul> <p><strong>Additional editing features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Rotation</li> <li>Crop</li> </ul> <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"></p> <h3 id="testing-the-lenses">Testing the lenses</h3> <p>After having lunch at <em>Ponta do Garajau</em> restaurant, in Ribeira Quente, we also visited the Santa Iria viewpoint. A sort of small peninsula stands out from the entire view. I felt this was perfect to test out the different lenses.

During the entire day, the sky was very clear, so it allowed for some amazing pictures. I took one on sunrise and one in the beginning of the night. The night picture was very tricky to edit since the camera was not exposed to a lot of light, even though it was full moon. I did my best to make it a decently looking image, but I feel like it still was not enough.

I used to spend summer days exploring how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other programming languages and tools could be used to develop the front-end of a web-browser page. However, I did not have the skill at the time to make that vision a reality.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/website-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/website-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/website-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/website.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Code of a website" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Snippet of website development code </div> <p>Now that I have had some experience with programming, and looking for the right tools and resources, I came up with a solution that enables me to make my past child goal a dream come true. But what could I show the world in my website? Will it just be a random access point which will serve no purpose?</p> <p>Well, another thing which I always envisioned (but admit to being lazy on putting hands on) was to compile all the information and expertise I have gathered over time in a single place. I would then be able to access this information wherever I wanted to and show it to the right people at the right time.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">The combination of these two goals merged into a single one, which stands to be the website from which you are now reading in this post. And now that I have mentioned the word 'post', here comes the third purpose for the website that surged as I was exploring what functionalities I could give it: sharing my ideas and experiences.</p> <h3 id="what-to-post"><b>What to post?</b></h3> <p>Since social media is out of question at this point, what kind of posts will I be doing in here? Instead of quick ‘stories’ with pictures and videos from what is happening at the moment (which I find a little privacy obstructive), I will be doing more insightful posts. On the first days of the website, there will be more posts about some work and projects I have laid my hands on. But it will not stay that way for long. As I have mentioned, I want to document what is possible when it comes to my past involvements in projects. Once that stage is over, it will be a mix between this and adventures, experiences, ideas, and goals for the future.</p> <p>For the professional related content, there will be more technical stuff, but I will also try to give a simpler view into what is going on. This way, more people may get to know more about my work and in turn it is self proof that I understand the concepts at a great level:</p> <blockquote> <p>If you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself. - <a href="https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/35209/which-of-these-quotes-are-actually-einsteins-if-any">Einstein probably</a></p> </blockquote> <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"></p> <p><em>Lourenço</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="website"/><category term="guidance"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background & motives]]></summary></entry></feed>
