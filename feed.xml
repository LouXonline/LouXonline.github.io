My last one was the iPhone 6S Plus, so it was a pretty big change. Not only in power, but in camera capabilities. This is even more evident if your old phone's camera does not focus on any object or area.</p> <p>Photography hasn't been a big interest of mine, or at least investing time in it was something I rarely considered. I would occasionally find amazing images shared in the internet of different places, moments, landscapes... Some of them very pleasant to observe. Why not create my own? Well, I never had the tools to begin with. But I gave it a shot recently.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"></p> <h3 id="the-first-picture">The first picture</h3> <p>I went on a trip to Furnas in my home island São Miguel with my parents and grandma. We ate breakfast there in the silence of the morning by the lake. This was my first proper picture with the phone:</p> <img-comparison-slider> <figure slot="first"> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas_unedited-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas_unedited-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas_unedited-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas_unedited.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Morning by the Furnas' lake unedited" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure slot="second"> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/photography_introduction/furnas.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Morning by the Furnas edited' lake" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </img-comparison-slider> <div class="caption"> Morning by the Furnas' lake </div> <p>I explored a few of the editing functionalities the iPhone provides in the camera app and tried to make the image more pleasant. My main idea with the editing on this one was to make it feel like a calm morning, vegetation standing out with some humidity and vibrant but realistic colors, and displaying a clear blue sky. I believe it was a good result. Nonetheless, it was a first attempt at editing.</p> <p>One of the keys aspects I learned through this is that too much editing may be doing exactly what you want in general, but the image may lose detail in some areas. This is not optimal, unless it isn’t noticeable. The bushes are the main object affected by the editing in negative terms, losing some detail to darker tones. However, it gives the impression that the tree’s shadow has some influence in the matter.</p> <p>Below is a brief description of every functionality I explored <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p> <p><strong>Light controls:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Exposure - act as though more or less light got into the lens</li> <li>Brilliance - lighten shadows while toning down highlights</li> <li>Highlights - adjust the brightness of the lightest parts in the image</li> <li>Shadows - adjust the brightness of the darkest parts in the image</li> <li>Contrast - make the darker parts darker and the lighter parts lighter</li> <li>Brightness - make the entire image lighter or darker</li> <li>Black point - adjust the very darkest part of the image</li> </ul> <p><strong>Color controls:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Saturation - change the intensity of colors in the image</li> <li>Vibrancy - change the intensity of the least saturated colors</li> <li>Warmth - adjust the yellow and blue tones to warm or cool an image.</li> <li>Tint - adjust the green or magenta tones in your image</li> </ul> <p><strong>Detail controls:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Sharpness - sharpen the edges in your image</li> <li>Definition - make the details in your image clearer</li> <li>Noise reduction - reduce the graininess in your image</li> <li>Vignette - darken the corners of the image</li> </ul> <p><strong>Additional editing features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Rotation</li> <li>Crop</li> </ul> <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"></p> <h3 id="testing-the-lenses">Testing the lenses</h3> <p>After having lunch at <em>Ponta do Garajau</em> restaurant, in Ribeira Quente, we also visited the Santa Iria viewpoint. A sort of small peninsula stands out from the entire view. I felt this was perfect to test out the different lenses. Here are the results for the wide camera, 24mm lenses, 28mm lenses and 35 mm lenses, post-editing:</p> <swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="false" rewind="true"> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/photography_introduction/wide_earth-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/wide_earth-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/wide_earth-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/photography_introduction/wide_earth.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/photography_introduction/24_earth-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/24_earth-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/24_earth-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/photography_introduction/24_earth.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/photography_introduction/28_earth-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/28_earth-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/28_earth-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/photography_introduction/28_earth.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> <swiper-slide> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/photography_introduction/35_earth-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/35_earth-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/photography_introduction/35_earth-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/photography_introduction/35_earth.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </swiper-slide> </swiper-container> <div class="caption"> Santa Iria viewpoint </div> <p>This should be fairly obvious to some people, but the higher the focal length, the closer the image appears to be taken.

During the entire day, the sky was very clear, so it allowed for some amazing pictures. I took one on sunrise and one in the beginning of the night. The night picture was very tricky to edit since the camera was not exposed to a lot of light, even though it was full moon. I did my best to make it a decently looking image, but I feel like it still was not enough.

I used to spend summer days exploring how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other programming languages and tools could be used to develop the front-end of a web-browser page. However, I did not have the skill at the time to make that vision a reality.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/website-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/website-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/website-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/website.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Code of a website" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Snippet of website development code </div> <p>Now that I have had some experience with programming, and looking for the right tools and resources, I came up with a solution that enables me to make my past child goal a dream come true. But what could I show the world in my website? Will it just be a random access point which will serve no purpose?</p> <p>Well, another thing which I always envisioned (but admit to being lazy on putting hands on) was to compile all the information and expertise I have gathered over time in a single place. I would then be able to access this information wherever I wanted to and show it to the right people at the right time.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">The combination of these two goals merged into a single one, which stands to be the website from which you are now reading in this post. And now that I have mentioned the word 'post', here comes the third purpose for the website that surged as I was exploring what functionalities I could give it: sharing my ideas and experiences.</p> <h3 id="what-to-post"><b>What to post?</b></h3> <p>Since social media is out of question at this point, what kind of posts will I be doing in here? Instead of quick ‘stories’ with pictures and videos from what is happening at the moment (which I find a little privacy obstructive), I will be doing more insightful posts. In the first days of the website, there will be more posts about some work and projects I have laid my hands on. But it will not stay that way for long. As I have mentioned, I want to document what is possible when it comes to my past involvements in projects. Once that stage is over, it will be a mix between this and adventures, experiences, ideas, and goals for the future.</p> <p>For the professional related content, there will be more technical stuff, but I will also try to give a simpler view into what is going on. This way, more people may get to know more about my work and in turn it is self proof that I understand the concepts at a great level:</p> <blockquote> <p>If you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself. - <a href="https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/35209/which-of-these-quotes-are-actually-einsteins-if-any">Einstein probably</a></p> </blockquote> <p style="margin-bottom:1cm;"></p> <p><em>Lourenço</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="website"/><category term="guidance"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background & motives]]></summary></entry></feed>
