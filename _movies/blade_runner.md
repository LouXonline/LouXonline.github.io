### <b>Overview</b>

_Blade Runner_ (1982), directed by Ridley Scott, is a neo-noir science fiction film set in a dystopian Los Angeles in 2019, where bioengineered humans called “replicants” are created for dangerous or off-world labor. The story follows Rick Deckard, a weary ex-cop tasked with hunting down rogue replicants who have returned to Earth seeking longer lifespans. Blending detective mystery with philosophical themes, the film explores questions of identity, humanity, and morality against a backdrop of rain-soaked streets, towering megacities, and a haunting Vangelis score. Its atmospheric visuals, ambiguity, and moral complexity have made it a landmark in science fiction cinema.
